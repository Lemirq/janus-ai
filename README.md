# Janus AI

## Overview

Say goodbye to prompt engineering.

Janus is the union of AI and Human, a double-headed intelligent being with effortless access to the vast body of digital knowledge. Janus finds answers to questions in real time, generates optimal responses, and guides the user in persuasive delivery. For the user, the experience is simple and intuitive: simply talk as normal, and Janus provides useful information in real time, controlled by subtle gesture cues. From the second-person perspective, Janus is seamless. IT communicates with users via a bluetooth earpiece, monitoring conversations in real time, researching relevant topics, and providing targeted insights. We've also built Janus to excel in high-stakes scenarios like business pitches, sales calls, and legal settings. Users can define specific objectives in advance, and Janus will target persuasive techniques toward that particular audience to achieve the user's goal. 

**Custom Prosody Encoding:** We defined a custom prosody notation and finetuned Higgs Audio V2 on special prosody tokens for enhanced prosody modulation.  

**Novel Human-Annotated Dataset:** We annotated our own dataset, notated with our custom prosody notation. 

**Bilingual:** Janus has fully native support for both English and French. 

**Hardware Integration:** Janus reads accelerometer data to track gesture commands in real time, allowing fine-grained control with no text or voice commands. 

**Native iOS App** We implemented Janus as a native app for iOS.
