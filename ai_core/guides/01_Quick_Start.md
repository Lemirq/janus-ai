# Janus AI - Quick Start Guide

## âš¡ Get Best Quality (5 minutes) - RECOMMENDED

**Download pre-trained model** for 85%+ prosody consistency:

1. **Download**: [Pre-trained model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18uoP8ecfsCwDTEdTJZKzwhGTulTSoTsb/view?usp=sharing) (~180 MB)
2. **Create folder**: `ai_core/fine_tuning/models/`
3. **Extract ZIP** into the models folder
4. **Done!** Model loads automatically

**See**: `../fine_tuning/DOWNLOAD_MODEL.md` for detailed instructions

## ðŸš€ Or Use API (30 seconds, lower quality)

```powershell
# 1. Set API key
$env:BOSON_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# 2. Generate response
python main.py -i "How much?" -p "30% savings" "No fees"

# 3. Listen to output
start output/response.wav
```

**Note**: Without the pre-trained model, prosody is only 30-50% consistent

---

## ðŸ“‹ Common Commands

```powershell
# Single response
python main.py -i "Question" -p "Point 1" "Point 2"

# Interactive mode
python main.py --interactive

# Custom output file
python main.py -i "Is it secure?" -p "Military encryption" -o output/secure.wav
```

## ðŸ“Š What You Get

```
[INPUT] Their statement
[YOUR POINTS] To emphasize
[THINKING PROCESS] How AI reasoned
[FINAL RESPONSE] Plain and with prosody
[AUDIO FILE] Saved to output/
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Prosody Tokens (7 Total)

```
<emph>          - Emphasize word
<pause_short>   - Brief pause (0.5s)
<pause_long>    - Long pause (1.5s)
<pitch_high>    - Higher pitch
<pitch_low>     - Lower pitch
<pitch_rising>  - Rising intonation
<pitch_falling> - Falling intonation
```

---

## âœ… Verification

Your system works if:
- âœ“ Response makes sense (not thinking process)
- âœ“ Audio 5-20 seconds
- âœ“ File 300-700 KB
- âœ“ Saved to `output/` directory
