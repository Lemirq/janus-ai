<pitch_high> oh <pitch_low> yeah <pitch_high> how much time do you <pitch_low> spend looking at random leaves on television <pitch_low> shows to recognize that it's a fake pattern not created by the wind <pause_long> <pitch_high> no i just you know you look at scenes from walking <pitch_rising> dead and they enter this deserted <pitch_high> town as so many towns <pitch_high> are when zombies take over and the the the <pitch_high> leaves <pitch_high> you <pitch_low> know the the <pitch_falling> autumn <pitch_high> leaves are evenly spread in the streets and the <pitch_falling> sidewalks and i'm thinking <pitch_high> some set designer <pitch_high> did <pitch_low> that <pitch_falling> thinking <pitch_low> that <pitch_high> this is what leaves <pitch_falling> do in the <pitch_high> breeze but <pitch_high> that's <pitch_high> not <pitch_low> what they do they <pitch_rising> collect they <pitch_falling> circulate they're they're they're like <pitch_falling> eddies in the <pitch_high> air <pitch_low> currents that'll collect them in one place and not the <pitch_falling> other <pause_long> so so so <pitch_high> we <pitch_low> think if something's <pitch_falling> random that it's evenly <pitch_high> spread but in <pitch_high> fact there are <pitch_high> many <pitch_low> more <pitch_rising> collected <pause_short> <pitch_falling> elements in something that's random than we <pause_short> <pitch_high> typically think <pause_short> so i'm <pitch_high> looking at your new <pitch_high> ceiling here in austin <pitch_high> texas and your <pitch_high> star is <pitch_falling> beautiful by the way nice digs you got here <pitch_high> thank <pitch_low> you but uh the stars are <pause_short> [the <pitch_low> lights are <pitch_high> kind <pitch_low> of evenly spread on the <pitch_high> sky yeah they don't look <pitch_falling> real <pitch_low> so <pitch_high> that's how and <pitch_high> plus you know you <pitch_high> could have <pitch_low> thrown at least a constellation up there or something you <pitch_high> know what i should do i should <pitch_high> get someone to <pitch_high> make me one and make one <pause_short> and just imitate the milky <pitch_low> way <pitch_high> that'd be that'd be <pitch_high> beautiful right that'd be <pitch_high> beautiful and i'll be happy to certify it you give me a call i'm <emph> all in i don't think i don't think you will <pitch_falling> certify it i think it would be a real <emph> problem i think it could be a genuine <emph> issue so how you <pitch_high> doing <pitch_rising> joe i'm doing <pitch_high> good how are you doing yeah i used to <pitch_falling> austin is an old <pause_short> [haunt <pitch_low> of <pitch_low> mine <pitch_low> is <pitch_high> it yeah i met my <emph> wife here uh i i got my masters at ut <emph> austin my wife got her phd in mathematical physics <pause_short> there and i <pitch_high> finished my phd in columbia new york <pitch_rising> city but uh <pitch_high> we <pitch_low> spent six years here <emph> long <emph> ago i love it here we were here when <emph> austin texas had six gates at the <pitch_falling> airport and there was never more than <emph> one other car in front of you at a red <pitch_low> light just <pitch_falling> picture that a lot of folks remember that apparently and they they're very upset that i would be <emph> totally <pitch_low> pissed <pitch_low> off the <emph> traffic here is still adorable it's ridiculous <pause_short> cute <pitch_rising> traffic and the <pitch_high> people are so <emph> nice it's just a <pitch_rising> completely different <emph> vibe yeah so i miss you man did you see you're still still at it i'm still <pitch_high> at <pitch_low> it i'm still doing the thing and i thought <pause_short> you know i saw a few of your shows and i said i <pause_short> you know we can <pause_short> bring some some <pause_short> deep philosophical <pitch_low> thought <pitch_low> back because i know there's a part that's a big part of you <pitch_high> right uh <pitch_rising> occasionally no <pitch_low> it's <pitch_high> in <pitch_low> you <pitch_low> it's <pitch_high> in <pitch_low> you when i'm talking to the right people oh okay yeah <pitch_low> like <pitch_falling> you oh yeah <pitch_falling> yeah it <pitch_low> comes <pitch_falling> out it comes out good i haven't met you to talk to you i've been <pitch_falling> wanting to talk to you what what about that what are you doing <pitch_low> well <pitch_high> all these ufo <pitch_falling> disclosures <pitch_rising> yeah those are you're like one of the first guys that i want to <pitch_high> talk <pitch_low> to because you always have a skeptical <pitch_rising> inquisitive perspective <pitch_low> on these things you're not necessarily <pitch_rising> dismissive <pitch_falling> right but you're <pitch_high> not <pitch_falling> willing to just adopt this narrative that we're being <emph> visited by <emph> ufos or from another planet <pitch_falling> yeah so it's <pause_short> um <pause_short> by the way let's start with the <pitch_falling> military yeah <pitch_high> right <pause_short> if they're glowing lights in the <pitch_rising> sky and we don't know what it is i <pause_short> they damn sure better look <pitch_falling> into it right we <pitch_high> give them folks 700 billion <pitch_rising> dollars make <pitch_high> some <pitch_falling> percentage of that <pitch_falling> budget to check out the <emph> possible threat of things we don't <emph> understand <pitch_low> i <pitch_high> used to think that was a lot of money until i found out that los angeles spent a billion dollars on the <pitch_rising> homeless <pitch_rising> every <pitch_rising> year the budget for the <pitch_rising> homeless they got a homeless budget okay a <pitch_falling> billion and they're not doing all right so when i look at like the <pitch_falling> military getting 700 <pitch_rising> billion is that what they <pitch_high> get plus or minus we need to give them more <pitch_falling> money you know <pitch_falling> clearly they <pitch_low> need <pitch_low> more <pitch_falling> money because if you <pitch_high> can't <pitch_high> fix the la <pitch_rising> homeless situation with 1 <pitch_rising> billion how are you going to protect us with 700 billion <pitch_high> well <pitch_low> that's <pitch_low> not the same <pitch_falling> agency <pitch_high> charged <pitch_low> with <pitch_low> it are they <pitch_rising> better they're better than the homeless people <pitch_high> no <pitch_low> i'm <pitch_rising> saying the <pitch_falling> mayor's office of los <pitch_falling> angeles sucks <pitch_falling> boston <pitch_rising> right yeah who's <pitch_falling> running <pitch_falling> what i got in <pitch_falling> trouble this past <pitch_falling> february when the <pitch_falling> electricity went out in <pitch_falling> texas and it was <pitch_falling> cold just just a couple of <pitch_high> months <pitch_low> ago what did you say what i <pitch_high> say
